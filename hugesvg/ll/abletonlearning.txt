-- Get started

In these lessons, you'll learn the basics of music making. No prior experience or equipment is required; you'll do everything right here in your browser.

To get started, check out the boxes below. Each one contains a small piece of music. Click a box to turn it on or off.

After playing with these boxes for a while, you'll discover certain combinations that you like. Many types of music are created in exactly this way — by mixing and matching small musical ideas to make interesting combinations, and then changing those combinations over time.

Now you've combined pre-made musical patterns. Next, you'll make some patterns of your own.

-- Beats

This grid shows the "inside" of a musical pattern.

You can click in the grid boxes to make your own version by creating or deleting notes.

The notes are the same; we've just changed the sounds. But this gives each version its own unique character.

The four types of sounds in these grids are among the most commonly used drum sounds in many styles of both acoustic and electronic music. Here's a bit more about them:

Kick

Kick drum

Also called a bass drum, an acoustic kick is struck by a pedal with a beater attached, and is played by the drummer's foot. Electronic versions of this sound are sometimes made to sustain much longer than the relatively short sound produced by a physical drum.

Compare an electronic and an acoustic kick:

Keyboard
Electronic Kick

Click on the pads to play a sound.
Close
Clap

Clap

This is the sound of one or more people clapping their hands. Today, electronic, stylized versions of this sound (like the one used here) are much more common than actual recordings of handclaps.

Snare

Snare

A snare drum is struck with a drum stick, and produces a short, bright sound. A set of wires (called snares) is stretched across a drum head at the bottom of the drum. The vibration of the bottom drum head against the snares produces the drum's characteristic "cracking" tone.

Claps, snares, and other "sharp" or "bright" sounds are often used in similar ways in drum patterns.

Compare an electronic clap and an acoustic snare sound:

Closed Hat and Open Hat

Hi-hat

These are two different sounds created by an instrument called the hihat. Hihats are a pair of small cymbals mounted on a stand. The top cymbal is attached to a rod that is raised and lowered with a foot pedal. Hihats are "closed" when the drummer's foot is down, which presses the cymbals together. They are "open" when the drummer's foot is raised and the cymbals are not touching. On an acoustic drumset, there is a huge range of states in between the open and closed position, and each state creates a different type of sound.

-- -- Beat and tempo

Beat and tempo

What's a "beat?"

People commonly use the word "beat" to mean "a pattern (or rhythm) played by drums." The thing you're making when you create and play patterns in these lessons is "a beat."

But, confusingly, there's another use of the word "beat," which means "a regular, repeating pulse that underlies a musical pattern." People tap their foot along with "the beat" in this context.

Tempo

The speed at which your patterns play back is called the tempo. Tempo is measured in beats per minute or BPM. So if we talk about a piece of music being "at 120 BPM," we mean that there are 120 beats (pulses) every minute.

Some types of musical patterns have a very clear underlying beat, while others have a more subtle or implied one. To hear a steady beat, add notes on the Kick line at the positions labeled 1, 5, 9, and 13.

 This pattern is so common that it even has its own name: "four on the floor."

Now try adding some notes for the top three rows, but leave the Kick row alone. Notice that no matter what you do in the other rows, the steady pattern in the Kick line makes it really hard to lose the sense of clear pulse.




-- -- Tempo and genre


Tempo and genre

The style (or genre) of a piece of music is determined by a number of factors, including the types of sounds and patterns used, and also the tempo.

You probably have some idea about the genre of a song when you hear it, just based on your experiences as a music listener. Here are "typical" tempo ranges for a number of common genres:

Dub: 60-90 bpm
Hip-hop: 60-100 bpm
House: 115-130 bpm
Techno/trance: 120-140 bpm
Dubstep: 135-145 bpm
Drum and bass: 160-180 bpm
Try adjusting the tempo while this beat plays and listen to how it changes character, even if the pattern stays exactly the same.





-- -- Backbeats

Backbeats

In the empty grid below, do the following:

Create the "four on the floor" pattern in the Kick row again.
Add notes in the Clap row at the positions labeled 5 and 13.
Many styles of music that are "in four" feature a clap or snare on the second and fourth beat, a pattern known as a backbeat.

-- -- Bars

Bars

So far, all of the drum patterns you've looked at loop back to the beginning after four beats. This grouping of four beats is called a bar or measure.

Here's a drum pattern that's two bars long:

Songs are made by putting multiple bars of music together to form larger sections, and then putting these larger sections together.

Notice that the house and rock beats are extremely similar. Besides their different tempos and minor differences in the hihat and kick drum lines, these patterns are the same. You'll find certain drum patterns reused in many styles.

The drum sounds in the original song are made entirely with body percussion. The "kick drum" line is foot stomps on a wooden floor, while the hand clap sounds are real hand claps.

Beyoncé - “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)”


In the previous beat examples, you may have noticed that the hihats usually play steady repeating patterns, often every half beat. But in this example, the sounds are used in somewhat unconventional ways. Here, there's still a steady pattern every half beat, but it's played by a clap sound, and there are no hihats at all.

The snare is played only once in the pattern. See if you can fill in this single hit.

Now that you've experimented with some musical examples, spend some time creating your own beats.

This beat grid works just like the one you've been using, but you can also record into it as you play. When you're recording, you'll hear a click on each beat, so that it's easier to play at the right tempo.

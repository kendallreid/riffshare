-- Get started

In these lessons, you'll learn the basics of music making. No prior experience or equipment is required; you'll do everything right here in your browser.

To get started, check out the boxes below. Each one contains a small piece of music. Click a box to turn it on or off.

After playing with these boxes for a while, you'll discover certain combinations that you like. Many types of music are created in exactly this way — by mixing and matching small musical ideas to make interesting combinations, and then changing those combinations over time.

Now you've combined pre-made musical patterns. Next, you'll make some patterns of your own.

-- Beats

This grid shows the "inside" of a musical pattern.

You can click in the grid boxes to make your own version by creating or deleting notes.

The notes are the same; we've just changed the sounds. But this gives each version its own unique character.

The four types of sounds in these grids are among the most commonly used drum sounds in many styles of both acoustic and electronic music. Here's a bit more about them:

Kick

Kick drum

Also called a bass drum, an acoustic kick is struck by a pedal with a beater attached, and is played by the drummer's foot. Electronic versions of this sound are sometimes made to sustain much longer than the relatively short sound produced by a physical drum.

Compare an electronic and an acoustic kick:

Clap

Clap

This is the sound of one or more people clapping their hands. Today, electronic, stylized versions of this sound (like the one used here) are much more common than actual recordings of handclaps.

Snare

Snare

A snare drum is struck with a drum stick, and produces a short, bright sound. A set of wires (called snares) is stretched across a drum head at the bottom of the drum. The vibration of the bottom drum head against the snares produces the drum's characteristic "cracking" tone.

Claps, snares, and other "sharp" or "bright" sounds are often used in similar ways in drum patterns.

Compare an electronic clap and an acoustic snare sound:

Hi-hat

These are two different sounds created by an instrument called the hihat. Hihats are a pair of small cymbals mounted on a stand. The top cymbal is attached to a rod that is raised and lowered with a foot pedal. Hihats are "closed" when the drummer's foot is down, which presses the cymbals together. They are "open" when the drummer's foot is raised and the cymbals are not touching. On an acoustic drumset, there is a huge range of states in between the open and closed position, and each state creates a different type of sound.
